# Developer Guide

This guide explains the contributor workflow for the generated Evert project.

## Local Workflow

Use `make all` as the public entrypoint for formatting, linting, and tests.
`make lint` runs rustdoc, Clippy, and Whitaker. `make test` prefers
`cargo nextest run` and falls back to `cargo test` when cargo-nextest is not
available. `make audit` derives the Rust workspace root with `cargo metadata`,
logs workspace member manifests, and runs `cargo audit` once from the workspace
root. `make coverage` uses `cargo llvm-cov` with `lld`.

GitHub Actions Act validation lives in `.github/workflows/act-validation.yml`.
The main `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow deliberately does not run
`make test WITH_ACT=1`; the separate Act workflow runs those slower
container-backed checks in parallel.

## Spelling policy

`make all` and `make markdownlint` enforce en-GB-oxendict spelling with the
`TYPOS_VERSION` pin in the `Makefile`. The gate first tests the policy helper,
refreshes the shared base dictionary, generates `typos.toml`, and scans tracked
Markdown files.

The shared dictionary is maintained in `leynos/agent-helper-scripts`. Its
repository-local cache and freshness metadata are untracked. The helper
replaces the cache only when the authoritative copy is newer and can reuse a
valid cached copy while offline. A clean checkout with an unavailable network
retains the reviewed, tracked `typos.toml` policy.

Do not edit generated entries in `typos.toml`. Put only repository-specific
proper nouns, quoted upstream titles, fixtures, stems or exclusions in
`typos.local.toml`, then regenerate with:

```bash
uv run scripts/generate_typos_config.py
```

Keep upstream API spellings in inline or fenced code where practical. The
spelling gate deliberately ignores code spans and fenced code blocks.

## Tooling

Development builds use Cranelift for debug code generation. On Linux targets,
`.cargo/config.toml` configures clang to link with `mold` so debug builds link
quickly. Coverage generation uses `lld` because LLVM coverage tooling expects
LLVM-compatible linker behaviour.

Install `clang`, `lld`, `mold`, `python3`, and `cargo-audit` before running the
full generated workflow locally on Linux.

### Security audit ignores

Security audit jobs may set `CARGO_AUDIT_IGNORES` for narrowly scoped RustSec
advisories that affect unused or tooling-only dependency paths. Keep each
ignore tied to a documented runtime impact analysis, and remove it when the
affected dependency leaves the graph or the project starts using the advised
runtime path.
